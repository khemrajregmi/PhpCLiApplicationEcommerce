# CLI Script

CLI script which will read JSON based data from a specific endpoint via HTTP. The script will contain several sub-
commands to filter and output the loaded data. The commands should be:

ðŸ‘‰ Find objects by price range (given price_from and price_to as arguments).

ðŸ‘‰ Find objects by a certain sub-object definition.

# Command for CLI (Examples)
go to the project directory and copy/paste the following command
`php run.php count_by_price_range 12.00 145.80`

`php run.php count_by_vendor_id 42`

**Implementation :**

ðŸ‘‰ Used PHP 8.2.

ðŸ‘‰ Not used framework at all.

ðŸ‘‰ Implemented the ReaderInterface for fetching the JSON HTTP endpoint and thus work with the OfferCollectionInterface and OfferInterface on the loaded data (see below). 

ðŸ‘‰  Written at least one unit test for a small component of the script.

ðŸ‘‰  Implemented logging.
